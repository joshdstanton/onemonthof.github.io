<h1>TL;DR</h1>

<p>Something I have learned about myself is that I have a very adventurous
and persistent personality that drives me to think big and want more for myself.
However, I sometimes struggle with committing to projects for the long term
and I often find myself discouraged when I set out to achieve an ambitious goal and then lose
motivation half way through. This is something I think is not unique to myself;
I bet it stops a lot of people from doing more with their time, too. 

<p>I have decided that committing to large, unbounded challenges has in the past
turned into a motivation problem when I'm not able to execute it the way I had
imagined. And so I have come up with a concept that I am excited to experiement with,
and which has led me to make this blog to document and test out my theory.
This is in of itself one of my "think big" moments.

<strong>My solution is not to stop thinking big or to take on fewer challenges,
but instead to commit to these challenges with a pre-determined measurement for success
and end date in mind. I'm calling this <i>One Month Of... Challenges</i></strong>

<h1>Example</h1>
<p>I want to cook for my family more often to give my wife a break and also
because I think that my "culinary skills" could grow beyond <i>Mac N' Cheese</i>
and <i>hot dogs</i>. However, committing for the rest of my life to cook one meal
a week is noble, but what happens when I miss a week? Or what if my motivation wanes?
Beginning with an end date in mind means there is end in sight to give me hope
and to push me to what could be a breakthrough in something I might actually find enjoyable.

<h1>One Month Of... Challenges</h1>
<p>This leads me to my one month of challenges. I am going to attempt to
learn or do something new once a month for one year. Each month will have
a new challenge with it's own unique guidelines. In addiction, I will post here:
<ul>
  <li>what I am attempting to do,</li>
  <li>how long the it will take (should be just a month but who knows)</li>
  <li>how often I plan on doing said challenge,</li>
  <li>how I plan to measure my success and</li>
  <li>any guidelines that apply to that month's challenge.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>This mold is designed to be broken.</blockquote>

<p>Some examples of things that I could see myself doing are: cooking, art,
music, geography, contributing to open source projects, writing, language
studies, math, computer science etc...

<p>Basically, a lot of what I learned in school that I didn't find
terribly interesting then, but which now I want to explore more deeply to give myself a
more well-rounded view of the world and of myself.

<h1>Challenge #1</h1>
<p>Pick a subject of learning or an area I feel I am weak in and dive into it.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Duration:</dt>
  <dd>1 year.</dd>

  <dt>Frequency:</dt>
  <dd>Once a month.</dd>

  <dt>Measure of Success:</dt>
  <dd>If after a year I have completed at
  least 12 challenges, making at least 1 blog post per month at the beginning of
  the challenge to outline the task and 1 blog post at the end of the challenge
  to review my success.  In the middle, any number of blog posts with updates. That
  will be a success. Anything less is a failure, but that's something that I can
  live with!</dd>

  <dt>Additional guidelines:</dt>
  <dd>This should be fun. I'd hate to push
  myself for a year and then regret doing it. I should also be flexible and open to
  adjusting my premise and rules. If it doesn't look like I can do a month due to
  my circumstances I wont feel guilty for skipping or stopping or if it looks like
  I was wrong and my motivations were more than I've outlined I should be willing
  to re-evaluate.</dd>
  
  <p><i>An additional note:</i> This is not to say that all things in life should
have an end date in mind. There are times in life where doing something without an
expected end date or measurement for success is a important. If a challenge doesn't
fit this mold that doesn't mean it's not a worthwhile or meaningful goal. 
The first example that comes to mind is raising my kids. The measure of success is constantly
changing depending on the season of life that my wife and I are in. Sometimes it's going to
be very difficult to determine what success looks like. But obviously that doesn't mean it's not
worthwhile endeavor. And I could never set an end date for parenting or being a husband. 
Marrying my wife was and having my two beautiful children is a life decision I made with
no end to sight.
