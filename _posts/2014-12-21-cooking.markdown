<h1>One Month Of Cooking</h1>
<p>It's no secret that my wife does all the cooking in the house and there is a
reason for it too. The range of foods that I know how to prepare is embarrassing!
But I mean, it's just following directions right? How hard can that be?!

    For clarity I'm the chef in this comic.

<h1>Challenge #2</h1>
<p>Learn to cook a decent meal!</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Duration:</dt>
  <dd>1 month.</dd>

  <dt>Frequency:</dt>
  <dd>Once a week.</dd>

  <dt>Measure of Success:</dt>
  <dd>If after a month I still have a job as father and husband I think that's a
  good start. Though I would hope that I will learn something about cooking
  along the way. I know I will have succeeded if I have at least 2 to 4 more
  <i>go to</i> recipes that don't involve the majority of the ingredients
  coming from a box. One night a week I plan on cooking an entire meal for my
  wife and kids, as much from scratch as I can manage. This will not only be fun
  for me but this will hopefully give my wife a night off too!

  <dt>Additional guidelines:</dt>
  <dd>I'll post pictures / recipes of the meals I prepare with honest feedback
  from whoever is brave enough to eat whatever I cook! Pretty excited! Merry
  Christmas!
