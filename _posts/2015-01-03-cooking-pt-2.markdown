<h1>Beef Wellington</h1>
<p>I followed Gordan Ramsey's holiday beef wellington recipe and wow it was to
die for. 2lb beef tenderloin seared and then smothered in whole grain mustard
then wrapped in duxelles and 24 month aged prosciutto di Parma. Finally wrapped
with a pastry and baked until golden brown. Paired with red wine, mashed
potatoes and asparagus (not shown).</p>
<p>The day started off with a wonderful trip to Pike's Place Market, and
finished with a very stressful time cooking this amazing meal. Lessons learned,
good ingredients are expensive, improv is necessary when you don't have paid
kitchen staff to prep all the ingredients for you perfectly, and sometimes
seasoning beyond the point of comfort produces some amazing results.</p>
